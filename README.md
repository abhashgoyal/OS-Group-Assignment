## Abhash//Ajinkya//Aditya
A host of a party has invited N > 2 guests to his house. Due to fear of Covid-19 exposure, the host does not wish to open the door of his house multiple times to let guests in. Instead, he wishes that all N guests, even though they may arrive at different times to his door, wait for each other and enter the house all at once. The host and guests are represented by threads in a multithreaded program. Given below is the pseudocode for the host thread, where the host waits for all guests to arrive, then calls openDoor(), and signals a condition variable once. You must write the corresponding code for the guest threads. The guests must wait for all N of them to arrive and for the host to open the door, and must call enterHouse() only after that. You must ensure that all N waiting guests enter the house after the door is opened. You must use only locks and condition 1 variables for synchronization. The following variables are used in this solution: lock m, condition variables cv host and cv guest, and integer guest count (initialized to 0). You must not use any other variables in the guest for synchronization. //host lock(m) while(guest_count < N) wait(cv_host, m) openDoor() signal(cv_guest) unlock(m).
